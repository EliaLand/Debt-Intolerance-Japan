# Debt Intolerance Threshold Simulation Japan

Based on Reinhart C., Rogoff K. & Savastano M., 2003, *Debt Intolerance*, National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper Series, August 2003, USA

The following simulation aims to assess whether and under which intensity history matters in forecasting Japan's ability to sustain, from moderate to high, levels of external indebtedness. When we refer to history, we mean a country's records at meeting its debt obligations and managing its macroeconomy, which result to be highly dependent from consolidated fiscal structures and financial systems seldom varying across years. We also define a "safe" debt threshold as the marginal forecasted value of S&P credit ranking under which the tested country is downgraded to a lower cluster within its macrogroup (Club A, Club B & Club C, according to Reinhart, 2003). From these assumptions, we develop an empirical model that includes a very few number of variables attempting to represent in the best way the impact of the three major forces shaping debt sustainability dynamics: repayment history, indebtness level and history of macroeconomic stability. It is worth to mention that the presented empirical approach includes also a new proxy capturing the effect of political stability and, hence, an assumed higher farshightedness in macroeconomic and budgetting policy planning in the Japanese political framework. More room within the model is also dedicated to the impact of inflation dydanimcs from a comparative prespective, with respect to the existing literature.
